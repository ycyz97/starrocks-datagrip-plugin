# StarRocks SQL Syntax Coverage

中文版：[`SYNTAX_COVERAGE.zh-CN.md`](SYNTAX_COVERAGE.zh-CN.md)

This document tracks the StarRocks SQL syntax implemented by the plugin. It is
intended as a working checklist rather than a claim of full compatibility.

## Baseline and status definitions

- Target baseline: StarRocks 4.1, as declared by the project README.
- Official source: [StarRocks SQL statements documentation][official-statements].
- Documentation snapshot reviewed: 2026-07-16, from the official repository's
  `main/docs/en/sql-reference/sql-statements` tree.
- Grammar source of truth: [`grammar/starrocks.bnf`](grammar/starrocks.bnf).
- Parser lexer source of truth: [`grammar/starrocks.flex`](grammar/starrocks.flex).
- Regression scenarios: [`src/testData/sql`](src/testData/sql).

Because the official documentation repository can change after this snapshot,
each item must be checked against the actual StarRocks 4.1 documentation before
being marked complete.

Status meanings:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Complete | The documented statement and its important branches have structured grammar and parser tests. |
| Partial | A statement entry exists, but documented clauses or variants are missing or simplified. |
| Missing | No corresponding top-level grammar entry was found. |
| Review | The mapping or version applicability still needs manual confirmation. |
| N/A | The page is not a SQL parser entry, for example an HTTP loading API or a concept page. |

An item should only move to **Complete** when all of the following are present:

- a structured BNF rule without a whole-statement fallback;
- lexer tokens for StarRocks-specific syntax;
- at least one positive parser test with no PSI errors;
- tests for important optional branches and ambiguous prefixes;
- formatter and PSI/reference checks when the statement exposes SQL objects.

## Current summary

The plugin currently provides strong coverage for core queries, common table
DDL/DML, views, materialized views, catalogs, and resources. Coverage is much
less complete for cluster administration, statistics jobs, loading lifecycle
commands, and newer managed object families.

The official directory contained 196 Markdown pages at the review snapshot.
This is not a denominator for a compatibility percentage: it includes SELECT
subclauses, feature pages, and non-SQL entry points as well as standalone SQL
statements.

| Area | Current assessment | Main evidence or limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SELECT and expressions | Partial, high coverage | CTE, joins, subqueries, set operations, windows, `QUALIFY`, and grouping sets have regression coverage. `OFFSET`, `PIVOT`, and `SELECT * EXCLUDE` need review or implementation. |
| Table DDL | Partial, high coverage | CREATE, DROP, TRUNCATE, CTAS, LIKE, partitioning, distribution, indexes, and common table properties are modeled. `ALTER TABLE` covers only a limited action set. |
| DML | Partial, high coverage | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE have structured entries and scenarios; documented variants still require branch-by-branch comparison. |
| Views | Partial | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and SHOW CREATE are represented; official optional clauses require verification. |
| Materialized views | Partial | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, REFRESH, and SHOW forms are partly covered; cancellation and status-management variants remain. |
| Databases and schemas | Partial | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, USE, and common SHOW forms exist; SHOW DATA and SHOW CREATE DATABASE require work. |
| Catalogs | Partial | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, SHOW CATALOGS, and SHOW CREATE CATALOG exist; SET CATALOG is missing. |
| Resources | Partial | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and SHOW RESOURCES exist; documented variants need comparison. |
| Accounts and privileges | Partial | Common user/role DDL, GRANT, REVOKE, and SET PASSWORD exist; role switching, impersonation, and several SHOW forms are missing. |
| Backup and restore | Partial | BACKUP, RESTORE, repository operations, and RECOVER have simplified grammar. |
| Loading, export, and tasks | Partial | Broker Load, CANCEL LOAD, Routine Load, SUBMIT TASK, and EXPORT are partly modeled. Lifecycle and Pipe commands are mostly absent. |
| Statistics | Partial, low coverage | ANALYZE TABLE and selected SHOW forms exist. Analyze-job lifecycle statements are mostly absent. |
| Cluster administration | Partial, low coverage | SET, KILL, SYNC, EXPLAIN, SHOW PROC, and a small ADMIN SHOW subset exist. Most official cluster-management commands are absent. |
| Function DDL | Missing | Function invocation/catalog support does not imply CREATE/DROP FUNCTION syntax support. |
| Pipes and dictionaries | Missing | No top-level grammar families were found. |
| Storage volumes and resource groups | Missing | No top-level grammar families were found. |

## Existing regression coverage

The current scenario manifest covers 17 SQL fixture files and includes core
query, nested query, set/window query, table DDL, materialized views, views,
complex types, functions, catalogs/resources, load/tasks, administration,
security/transactions, DML mutations, export/analyze, and backup/restore.

[`StarRocksParsingTest.testEveryDeclaredScenarioBuildsAnErrorFreePsiTree`](src/test/kotlin/com/github/ycyz/starrocks/datagrip/StarRocksParsingTest.kt)
requires each declared scenario to build a PSI tree without parser errors. This
proves the declared fixtures, not full official syntax coverage.

## Maintenance workflow

For each implementation batch:

1. Open the corresponding official StarRocks 4.1 statement page.
2. Record the documented syntax branches in the relevant checklist item.
3. Add or extend structured rules in `grammar/starrocks.bnf` and tokens in
   `grammar/starrocks.flex` where required.
4. Add focused parser tests, including optional clauses and error recovery.
5. Add a scenario fixture when the statement represents a new coverage family.
6. Run `validateGrammarSources`, `validateStarRocksScenarios`, and `test`.
7. Change an item to Complete only after the grammar and tests cover the
   documented important branches.
8. Add a short evidence note or link to the exact grammar/test location.

Do not calculate an overall percentage until every official page has been
classified as Complete, Partial, Missing, Review, or N/A using a stable 4.1
documentation snapshot.
